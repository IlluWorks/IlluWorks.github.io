									In order to provide you with personalized software solution (the “Illu Service”), Illu Global Inc. (“Illu”) needs you to provide certain information relating to you, and from which, either alone or connected with other information to which we may have access, you can be individually identified (“Personal Information”). We take the privacy of this Personal Information very seriously. In this policy (“Privacy Policy”) we explain what type of Personal Information we collect, how we collect your Personal Information, and how we will use the Personal Information you provide.
							<br>
							<br>
Illu follows the below principles in order to protect your privacy:
						</p>
						<ul class="mb-8 fs-1 text-dark-1" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="750">
							<li>
										We do not collect any more Personal Information about you than is necessary;
							</li>
							<li>
										Unless you agree otherwise, we only use your Personal Information for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy;
							</li>
							<li>
										We do not keep your Personal Information for longer than necessary; and

						</h3>
						<ol class="mb-8 fs-1 text-dark-1" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="750">
							<li>
										Personal Information provided by you. Illu collects Personal Information by asking you questions about yourself as well as your contact information, and we then use this information to create your Illu profile (“Illu Profile”). You may also provide such information through any website, mobile application or other platform provided to you by Illu, and during any download, registration, login or use of the Illu Service. The information you may provide us directly includes your contact information (such as your name, email address, mailing address, billing address and mobile phone number), your username and password and other information that you send to us. Illu also collects certain Personal Information for administration of the Illu Service, including account credentials and payment information. Please note that payment card information is stored and maintained by our third-party payment processors.

								<br>
							</li>
							<li>
										Personal Information automatically collected. During your use of the Illu Service, we automatically record information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit our mobile software application, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device identifiers (including the manufacturer and model), Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system, browser type and version, pages that you visit before and after using the Illu Service, the date and time of your visit, and other standard server log data. We use this information to measure the usage of the Illu Service and to assist in our analytics, security, and error handling. This in turn helps us understand how to serve you better.
								<br>
								<br>We may use cookies, pixel tags, Local Shared Objects, and similar technologies to automatically collect information.  Cookies are small bits of information that are stored by your computer’s web browser.  Pixel tags are very small images or small pieces of data embedded in images, also known as “web beacons” or “clear GIFs,” that can recognize cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, a description of the page where the pixel tag is placed, and similar information from your computer or device.  Local Shared Objects (sometimes referred to as “Flash Cookies”) are similar to standard cookies except that they can be larger and are downloaded to a computer or mobile device by the Adobe Flash media player.  By using the Illu Service, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies.
								<br>
								<br>We may also collect technical data to address and fix technical problems and improve the Illu Service, including the memory state of your device when a system or app crash occurs.  Your device or browser settings may permit you to control the collection of this technical data.  This data may include parts of a document you were using when a problem occurred, or the contents of your communications.  By using the Illu Service, you are consenting to the collection of this technical data.
								<br>
