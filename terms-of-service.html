										2. Our Responsibilities
							</h3>
							<p class="mb-8 fs-1 text-dark-1" data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="750">
										2.1 Provision of the Service. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Service available to Customer and its Users pursuant to this Agreement and the applicable Order Form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Service may not be available due to planned downtime (which We will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule to the extent practicable during low usage hours such as nights or weekends).  For clarity, any such scheduled or emergency maintenance will not constitute a breach of this Agreement or give rise to any liability for Illu for any reason. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.2 Access and Use. Subject to and conditioned on Customer’s payment of fees and compliance with all other terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Order Form, Illu hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable (except in compliance with Section 13.3), worldwide right to access and use, and permit Users to access and use, the Service solely for Customer’s internal business operations during the Subscription Term. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.3 Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Order Form, Illu hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 13.3) license to install, execute and use any mobile application software that We provide or otherwise make available to You or Your Users in connection with use of the Service as permitted herein and within the Order Form (collectively, “Installed Software”), in object code only, on devices owned or controlled by Customer or the applicable User (each, an “Authorized Device”), solely for Customer’s internal business operations during the Subscription Term. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.4 Documentation License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Order Form, Illu hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 13.3) license to use, and permit Users to use, the Documentation solely for Customer’s internal business purposes in connection with its use of the Service during the Subscription Term. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.5 Changes to the Service, Installed Software, and Documentation. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes to the Service, Installed Software and Documentation at any time that We deem necessary or useful to (a) maintain or enhance: (i) the quality or delivery of services to Our customers; (ii) the competitive strength of or market for Our services; or (iii) the Service’s cost efficiency or performance, or (b) to comply with applicable Law. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.6 Suspension or Termination of Service. We may, directly or indirectly, and by use of any lawful means, suspend, terminate, or otherwise deny Customer’s, any User’s, or any other Person’s access to or use of all or any part of the Service, without incurring any resulting obligation or liability, if: (a) Illu receives a judicial or other governmental demand or order, subpoena, or law enforcement request that expressly or by reasonable implication requires Illu to do so; or (b) Illu believes, in its good faith and reasonable discretion, that: (i) Customer or any User has failed to comply with any term of this Agreement, including payment obligations, or accessed or used the Service beyond the scope of the rights granted or for a purpose not authorized under this Agreement; (ii) Customer or any User is, has been, or is likely to be involved in any fraudulent, misleading, or unlawful activities relating to or in connection with the Service; or (iii) this Agreement expires or is terminated. This Section 2.6 does not limit any of Our other rights or remedies, whether at law, in equity, or under this Agreement.  Illu will not have any liability for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits), or any other consequences that Customer or any User may incur as a result of a suspension, termination or denial of the Service pursuant to this Section 2.6. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.7 Support. Each Subscription includes customer support services (“Support Services”) at the support levels applicable to the Subscription in accordance with the Illu service support schedule then in effect. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.8 Implementation Services. If You purchase implementation services such as bulk provisioning of User accounts or Customer training (“Implementation Services”), Illu shall provide such implementation services as set forth on the applicable Order Form. 
								<br>
								<br>
2.9 Subcontractors. We may engage third parties (each, a “Subcontractor”) to perform Our obligations under this Agreement in Our sole discretion, but We remain responsible for performance of any such Subcontractor. 
								<br>
								<br>
3.0 Reservation of Rights. Illu reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement.  Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to Customer or any third party any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to Our Materials or Our intellectual property rights.

								<br>
								<br>
3.3 Usage Limits. The Service is subject to usage limits, including, for example, the quantities or other limits specified in the applicable Order Form(s) (e.g., number of Users or Sites, and length of history for reports provided by the Service to You). 
								<br>
								<br>

Our Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, Our Materials and Documentation; and Confidential Information of each party includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing), as well as business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, business processes, and all other information in connection with the Service disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information that (a) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (b) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (c) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. 
								<br>
								<br>
7.2 Protection of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) (a) not to use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement, and (b) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only to those of its and its Affiliates’ employees, contractors and advisors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality obligations to the Receiving Party at least as protective as those herein. Neither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel, accountants and other representatives without the other party’s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel, accountants or other representatives will remain responsible for such Affiliate’s, legal counsel’s, accountant’s or other representatives’ compliance with this Section 7.2.  On the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed.  Each party’s obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire five years from the date first disclosed to the Receiving Party; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law. 
								<br>
								<br>
7.3 Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law or by the order of a court or similar judicial or administrative body to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.

12.2 Governing Law and Venue. This Agreement and any disputes arising under it will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and each party consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
								<br>
								<br>
12.3 Informal Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. The parties acknowledge that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. The parties will use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation with each other before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If, after good faith negotiations the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, including without limitation its existence, validity, or termination, shall be resolved according to California law and exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”) and pursuant to the then existing arbitration rules at JAMS. 
								<br>
								<br>
If the parties cannot agree upon selection of an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator experienced in the enterprise software industry. The place of the arbitration will be San Francisco, California unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator shall provide detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of any award. Judgment upon any such award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The existence of a dispute, submission to arbitration, and any arbitration award under to this Agreement is deemed the Confidential Information of both parties. 
								<br>
								<br>
The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of this Section 12.3 mandating arbitration shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
								<br>
								<br>
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12, (a) either party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief as set forth in Section 12.4 (Equitable Relief) below and to stop unauthorized use of the Service or infringement of Our Materials, Documentation or intellectual property rights and (b) any disputes, claims, or controversies concerning either party’s intellectual property rights or claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service shall not be subject to arbitration but instead must be heard in state or Federal court in San Francisco, California.

								<br>
12.4 Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 7 (Confidentiality) or, in the case of Customer, Section 3.5 (Usage Restrictions), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
